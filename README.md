# Machine Learning Application with Streamlit

This is a machine learning application built with Streamlit. It allows users to upload their own dataset or choose from example datasets, select features and target variables, choose the type of machine learning problem (classification or regression), and train various machine learning models on the data.

## Features

- Upload your own dataset or choose from example datasets (Titanic, Tips, Iris).
- Select features and target variable.
- Choose between classification and regression problem types.
- Train and evaluate different machine learning models.
- View data summary statistics and information.
- Interactive interface with Streamlit.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
2. Install the required dependencies:


## Usage

1. Once the Streamlit application is running, you can access it through your web browser.
2. Choose whether to upload your own dataset or use one of the provided examples.
3. Select the features and target variable from the dataset.
4. Choose the type of machine learning problem (classification or regression).
5. Click the "Run Analysis" button to train and evaluate the selected model.
6. View the results and evaluation metrics displayed in the interface.
